I am a linguist with a broad research profile in applied, corpus, and cognitive linguistics. A lot of my work revolves around chunking as a domain-general cognitive process. I have studied meaning-shift units in second language learning, perceptual chunking in speech processing, and individual variation from a usage-based perspective â€“ all of which in one or another way relate back to chunking. I am also interested in complexity theory, interdisciplinarity, and development of research methods.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
